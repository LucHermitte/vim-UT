PRESENTATION                                        *UT-presentation*  {{{1
UT is another Test Unit Framework for Vim, which main particularity is to fill
the |quickfix| window with the assertion failures.

Features~
- Assertion failures are reported in the |quickfix| window
- Meant to be simple to use
  - Simple assertion syntax (`:Assert expression`, `:AssertEquals(ref, expr)` ...)
  - Supports |:Comments|
  - Automatic registration of test functions
    - All the `s:Test*` functions of a suite are executed (almost)
      independently (i.e., a critical `:Assert!` failure will stop the Test of
      the function, and |lh#UT| will proceed to the next |s:Test()| function
  - A suite == a file
  - Several |s:Test()| functions per suite
  - Callstack is decoded and expanded in the quickfix window on uncaught
    |exception|s.
- Supports banged "`:Assert!`" to stop processing a given test on failed
  assertions
- Lightweight and simple to use: there is only one command defined, all the
  other definitions are kept in an autoload plugin.
- Fixtures:
  - optional |s:Setup()|, |s:Teardown()| executed before and after each test
  - optional |s:BeforeAll()|, |s:AfterAll()| executed once before and after all tests from a suite
- |local-function|s, |script-variable|s, and |local-variable|s are supported
- Counts successful tests and not successful assertions
- Short-cuts to run the Unit Tests associated to a given vim script; Relies
  on: |Let-Modeline|, |local_vimrc|/|project.vim| to set |g:UTfiles| (space
  separated list of glob-able paths), and on |lhvl#path|.
- Command to exclude, or specify the tests to play => |:UTPlay|, |UTIgnore|
- Takes advantage of |BuildToolsWrapper|'s |:Copen| command if installed

Requirements~
This suite requires Vim 7.1 and |lh-vim-lib| v5.1.0+.

USAGE                                               *UT-usage*         {{{1
First, create a new vim script, it will be a Unit Testing Suite.

                                                    *:UTSuite*
One of the first lines **must** contain >
  UTSuite Some intelligible name for the suite
<
                                                    *:Assert*
                                                    *:AssertTxt()*
                                                    *:AssertEquals()*
                                                    *:AssertDiffers()*
                                                    *:AssertIs()*
                                                    *:AssertIsNot()*
                                                    *:AssertMatches()*
                                                    *:AssertRelation()*
                                                    *:AssertThrows()*
Then you are free to directly assert anything you wish as long as it is a
valid vim |expression|, e.g. >
    Assert 1 > 2
    Assert 1 > 0
    Assert s:foo > s:Bar(g:var + 28) / strlen("foobar")
    AssertTxt! (s:foo > s:Bar(g:var+28),
        \, s:foo." isn't bigger than s:Bar(".g:var."+28)")
    AssertEquals('a', 'a')
    AssertDiffers('a', 'b')
    let dict = {}
    AssertIs(dict, dict)
    AssertMatch('abc', 'a')
    AssertRelation(1, '<', 2)
    AssertThrows 0 + [0]
or to define as many independent tests as you wish.

If banged, the test will be aborted on an assertion failure.

                                                    *:Comment*
Comments may be added to the |quickfix| report thanks to the |:Comment|
fake command.
                                                    *s:Test()*
A test is a function with a name starting with |s:Test|. Even if a test
critically fails, the next test will be executed, e.g. >
    function s:Test1()
      let var = SomeFucntion()
      Assert! type(var) == type(0)
      Assert var < 42
      Assert! var > 0

      " Some other code that won't be executed if the previous assertion failed
      let i = var / 42.0
      Comment This comment may never be displayed if {var} is negative or not a number
    endfunction

    function s:Test2()
      Assert s:what != Ever()
    endfunction
<
                                                    *UT-fixtures*
Reusable test-local Fixtures~
    If you wish to see a set-up function executed before each test, define the
    *s:Setup()* function.
    This function is usually named `BeforeEach` is other frameworks. If you'd
    rather user this name, please open an issue.

    If you wish to see a clean-up function executed after each test, define
    the *s:Teardown()* function.
    This function is usually named `AfterEach` is other frameworks. If you'd
    rather user this name, please open an issue.

Reusable suite-local Fixtures~
    If you wish to see a set-up function executed once before all tests from a
    suite, define the *s:BeforeAll()* function.

    If you wish to see a clean-up function executed once after all tests from
    a suite, define the *s:AfterAll()* function.

                                                    *:UTRun*
Finally run |:UTRun| on your test script (filename), and ... debug your failed
assertions from the |quickfix| window.

This can be done either with: >
    :UTRun %

or even with: >
    :UTRun tests/lh/*.vim

to run all tests matching `tests/lh/*.vim` in |getcwd()|.

TESTS ON BUFFER CONTENT                              *UT-buffer*       {{{1
Since version 2.0.0, simplified ways to set and test |buffers| content have been
provided.

                                                    *:SetBufferContent*
This fake command resets the content the content of the buffer.

Warnings:
- Be sure to be in a new buffer. By default, the current buffer is the
  instanciated test script being executed.
- No |autocommand| will be triggerred, IOW no action is done to detect the
  |filetype| or act on the buffer filetype.


:SetBufferContent {filename}                        *:SetBufferContent-file*
                        The buffer content is reset with the content of the
                        file specified.
                        Note that `:new | :SetBufferContent filename` could be
                        simplified into `:sp filename` which will also set the
                        filetype. `:SetBuffuerContent` becomes interresting to
                        use a same buffer for all tests, instead of creating
                        and removing a buffer before and after each test.

:SetBufferContent << [trim] {marker}                *:SetBufferContent<<*
line...
line...
{marker}
                        The buffer content is reset with the lines specified
                        in the following section. Internally, this command
                        relies on |:let=<<|. See its documentation regarding
                        "trim" or {marker}.

                                                    *:AssertBufferMatches*
This fake command tests whether the content of the current buffer is identical
to the specified file or a list of lines.

Differences will be displayed in the |quickfix-window|. Internally, they are
computed with |lh#diff#compute()|.
                                                    *UT-n_D*
Within the quickfix-window, we can hit `D` on the message associated to a
buffer matching failure in order to display, in a new |tabpage|, the expected
content alongside the expected content in |diff-mode|.
The diff-mode can be exited by hitting `q` from any scratch buffer involded.


:AssertBufferMatches[!] {filename}                  *:AssertBufferMatches-file*
                        The buffer content is tested against the file
                        specified.

:AssertBufferMatches[!] << [trim] {marker}          *:AssertBufferMatches<<*
line...
line...
{marker}
                        The buffer content is tested against the lines
                        specified in the following section. Internally, this
                        command relies on |:let=<<|. See its documentation
                        regarding "trim" or {marker}.

TO DO                                                *UT-todo*         {{{1
- Check UT works fine under windows (where paths have spaces, etc), and on
  UTF-8 files
- Simplify "`s:errors"` functions
- Support Embedded comments like for instance: >
    Assert 1 == 1 " 1 must value 1
- Ways to test buffers produced
- Find a way to prevent the potential script scope pollution
- Add a summary at the end of the execution

DESIGN CHOICES                                       *UT-design*       {{{1
The assertions supported by this plugin are expected to be made in a Unit
Testing file, they are not to be used in regular VimL scripts as a /Design by
Contract/ tool. Check Thomas Link's plugin, it is much more suited for that
kind of assertions.

In order to be able to produce the |quickfix| entries, the plugin first parses
the Unit Test file to complete all |:Assert| occurrences with extra
information about the line number where the assertion is made.
Incidentally, this permits to reduce plugin footprint: none of |:Assert|XXX
commands are actual commands.
